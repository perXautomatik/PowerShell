Sure, I can try to help you with writing a PowerShell snippet that would translate the path you provided. Here is one possible way to do it:

```powershell
# Define the input path
$inputPath = "H:\ToGit\.git\modules\CSharpVisualStudio\repos\modules\upg11\"

# Split the path by the backslash character
$pathParts = $inputPath -split '\\'

# Filter out the parts that contain .git or modules
$filteredParts = $pathParts | Where-Object {$_ -ne ".git" -and $_ -ne "modules"}

# Join the filtered parts with the backslash character
$outputPath = $filteredParts -join '\'

# Add a trailing backslash if the input path had one
if ($inputPath.EndsWith('\')) {
    $outputPath += '\'
}

# Display the output path
Write-Output $outputPath
```

This snippet should output the following:

```powershell
H:\ToGit\CSharpVisualStudio\repos\upg11\
```

I hope this snippet works for you. If you need more help, please let me know. ??
